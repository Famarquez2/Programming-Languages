# Prolog-Assignment
 - Purpose of this lab is to learn the basics of Prolog and how it functions.

## Intructions to install
  If working with OS operating system's please open terminal(if bash doesn't pop up, create 
  a new command and input "bash"). Make sure to have Homebrew installed, heres link to install
  https://brew.sh and paste script in MacOS terminal prompt. After installing homebrew, install 
  swi prolog, here's link to install https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/macos.html and paste the 
  suitable script for your project in the MacOS terminal prompt.
  
## Instructions to Compile and Run
  Since the syntax for prolog is different than other programming languages, its strongly recommended 
  to write statements/rules in a text editer(The shell script from Xcode is also a good option for 
  writing statements/rules on MacOS).
  
  1. Once finished adding statements/rules save file with file extension .pl
  2. Return to terminal and on terminal prompt either input swipl(This is to open swi prolog) or
     swipl "file name".pl (Do not add " ") to open a file in swi prolog. If opening file results
     in an error like source_sink, make sure file is in the right directory or spelled correctly with 
     extension .pl
  3. Once file is successfully open, it is read and automatically compiled unless theirs an error
  4. Write an argument with correct syntax and press enter to run the statements/rules from the 
     file that's open
  5. Output's result
  6. To try another argument repeat step 4 or to exit prolog enter "halt."
  7. To try another file exit prolog and repeat steps 2-5
 
 The link given above for SWI-Prolog has great tutorials, visit they're website to learn more about
 logical programming. I've included a report with images along with some exercises of prolog, I hope 
 you now have a better understanding of Logical Programming and Code on!
