# Haskell-Assignment
  Purpose of this assignment is to learn the basics of Haskell and how it functions.
  
# Intructions to install and open Haskell in MacOS terminal
  1. If working with a MacOS operating system, please open terminal (if bash doesn't open, create a new
     command and input in the command line "bash"). 
  2. Make sure to have Homebrew installed (heres link to install https://brew.sh , copy script and paste 
     in MacOS terminal prompt). 
  3. Next install the Haskell platfrom in terminal(Heres link to install https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/
     , copy the script suitable for your project and paste on the MacOS terminal prompt).
  4. On MacOS terminal prompt type "ghci" to open Haskell. You can now start creating programs in Haskell.
  
# Instructions to Compile and Run
  Theres a couple of ways of compiling and running programs in Haskell. For the ease of this project, writting 
  statements/expressions in a textfile makes it easy to edit code. 
  
  1. Once finished adding statements/expressions to the file, save file with file extension .hs
  2. Return to Macos terminal propmt and either input ghci (To open Haskell) or ghci "file name.hs" (Do not add " ").
     If opening a file results in an error, make sure file is in the correct directory or spelled correctly with 
     extension .hs
  3. Once file is successfully open, it is read and automatically compiled
  4. Write an arguement with the correct syntax and press enter to run statement/expressions from the open file
  5. Output result
  6. To try another arguement repeat step 4 or to exit Haskell enter ":quit"
  7. To try another file exit Haskell and repeat steps 2-5
  
  There is multiple tutorials for Haskell, visit Haskell's wiki page to learn more about the language
  (Here's link to Haskell's wiki page https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell ). I've included a report with tests along with 
  some extra exercises of Haskell, I hope you now have a better understanding of functional programming.
